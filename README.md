Project Notes
Part I : Sign up and Login Page. Need to use database. Incorporate firebase in android studio. Learn how to send data entered by user in app to firebase. Or try permanent data storage in android. Firebase is better option so that user can login via multiple devices. Check validity of email id and password and display appropriate message accordingly with toasting.
Part II : Setting up time table. Enter number of subjects. Depending on number entered by user, create ‘Dynamic’ views (Learn these). Enter subject names and shorthand. Enter credits for the subject. Prompt user to enter if labs have different credits. Once the user enters and clicks ‘OK’ button, display an empty table. Make use of fragments (Learn). The data that the user enters will be sent to the firebase. And at every textfield, there will be a drop down menu with which the user can choose to put the subject that he has entered previously. Also, add ‘BREAK’ to the drop down menu. 
Part III : Attendance ! The inbuilt cock of the device needs to be accessed. Depending on the clock. Calculate attendance on weekly basis. Ask user minimum percentage required. Auto increment every day. Ask user if lecture was conducted/cancelled or the entire day was a holiday.
Part IV : Pointer. Enter pointer for each subject. Display result.
Part V : Home Page. The user can go to different pages of the application namely: timetable, attendance percentage and pointer calculator.
// Learn about intents for page switching. Fragments, firebase, dynamic views, look up permanent storage.
// Use an clock for Indian standard time and display that in the app. This will prevent app from crashing. Check clock functioning thoroughly.
